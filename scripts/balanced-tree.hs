"Part" is a list of complete binary tree (2^d elements) with following
constraint:

* The first element is depth 0 tree (2^0 = 1 element), which is Leaf
* Depth of i-th element is i (full node) or i-1 (half node)

Example:

  # of elements  | List of depth | Is full?
  1              | [0]           | [1]
  2              | [0,0]         | [1,0]
  3              | [0,1]         | [1,1]
  4              | [0,0,1]       | [1,0,0]
  5              | [0,1,1]       | [1,1,0]
  6              | [0,0,2]       | [1,0,1]
  7              | [0,1,2]       | [1,1,1]
