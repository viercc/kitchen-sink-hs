# What's Nerdle and what this program is

[Nerdle](https://www.nerdlegame.com/) is a in-browser game similar to (and inspired by) [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

This program does analysis on the puzzles in Nerdle. I'm not involved in the development of Nerdle and I made it for pure curiosity.
